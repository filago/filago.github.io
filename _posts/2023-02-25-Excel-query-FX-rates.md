Spent way more time to create this than it could possibly ever save me, but 100% worth the effort for the learning.

A few of the key features of this file:
- pulls historical foreign exchange rates from online Federal Reserve Board data, into an Excel table.
- uses XLOOKUP formulas with spill to return records matching the user input dates, or closest earlier dates if not available. 
- uses further XLOOKUP formulas with IF logic to provide the most recent valid rate when a rate is listed as ND (no data.)
