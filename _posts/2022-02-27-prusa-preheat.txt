title:  "Prusa Preheat"

Here's how I save some time by preheating the Prusa printbed and nozzle when I first turn the printer on, whle waiting for the RPi Zero to boot and connect to OctoPrint.

Of course, you can do this directly through the Prusa menu as soon as it's on, but it's easier and faster to simply "print" a file from the SD card to make the settings for you.

For example, I have a file named "PETG preheat 170 &75C.gcode" with the following lines in it:

````
M104 S170 ; set nozzle temp to 170C, and don't wait
M140 S75 ; set bed temp to 75C, and don't wait
M84 ; disable motors to prevent popup showing that file is incomplete
M73 P100 R0 ; tell printer this code is finished
````

Through trial an error, I've figured out that 170 and 75C are pretty good starting points.  The nozzle doesn't drool much at that temp, and then they will both reach the final print temp at about the same time.

Other useful files are:

"Nozzle preheat 230C.gcode", to heat the nozzle for cleaning or filament changes without heating the bed.
````
M104 S230 ; set nozzle temp to 230C, and don't wait
M140 S0 ; set bed temp off, and don't wait
M84 ; disable motors to prevent popup showing that file is incomplete
M73 P100 R0 ; tell printer this code is finished
````

"temps off.gcode", which does what it says.
````
M104 S0 ; set nozzle temp off, and don't wait
M140 S0 ; set bed temp off, and don't wait
M84 ; disable motors to prevent popup showing that file is incomplete
M73 P100 R0 ; tell printer this code is finished
````

## Code

Source code can be included by fencing the code with three backticks. Syntax highlighting works automatically when specifying the language after the backticks.

````
M104 S170 ; set nozzle temp to 170C, and don't wait - 180 has minor drooling
M140 S75 ; set bed temp to 75C, and don't wait
M84 ; disable motors to prevent popup showing that file is incomplete
M73 P100 R0 ; tell machine that we're done
````
