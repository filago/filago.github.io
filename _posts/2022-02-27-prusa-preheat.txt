##Using a preheat GCODE file

Here's an easy way to set preheat temps on a Prusa.

Place a file on the SD card to "print" from the Prusa menu, which sets the desired temps.  Here's on I use, named "PETG preheat 170 & 75C.gcode" with just four lines:

````
M104 S170 ; set nozzle temp to 170C, and don't wait
M140 S75 ; set bed temp to 75C, and don't wait
M84 ; disable motors to prevent popup showing that file is incomplete
M73 P100 R0 ; tell printer this code is finished
````

Through trial an error, I've figured out that 170 and 75C are pretty good starting points.  The nozzle won't drool much, and then both bed and nozzle will reach the final temps about the same time when the print is launched.


Of course, preheat temps could be set directly through the Prusa menu, but I find it easier and faster to "print" a file from the SD card instead.



##Other useful files:

"Nozzle preheat 230C.gcode", to heat the nozzle for cleaning or filament changes without heating the bed.
````
M104 S230 ; set nozzle temp to 230C, and don't wait
M140 S0 ; set bed temp off, and don't wait
M84 ; disable motors to prevent popup showing that file is incomplete
M73 P100 R0 ; tell printer this code is finished
````

"temps off.gcode", which does what it says.
````
M104 S0 ; set nozzle temp off, and don't wait
M140 S0 ; set bed temp off, and don't wait
M84 ; disable motors to prevent popup showing that file is incomplete
M73 P100 R0 ; tell printer this code is finished
````
